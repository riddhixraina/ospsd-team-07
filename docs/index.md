# Issue Tracker Client

**OSPSD Team 07** — An abstract interface and Trello-backed implementation for an issue tracker client.

## Overview

This project provides:

- **`issue_tracker_client_api`** — Abstract interface for issue tracker operations (Client, Issue, Board, Member)
- **`trello_client_impl`** — Concrete implementation using the [Trello REST API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/rest/api-group-cards/)

The design supports dependency injection: implementations register at import time, and consumers use a single factory (`get_client`) to obtain the configured client.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
uv sync --all-extras

# Use the client
```

```python
import trello_client_impl
from issue_tracker_client_api import get_client, Client

client: Client = get_client(interactive=False)
for issue in client.get_issues(max_issues=5):
    print(issue.title)
for board in client.get_boards():
    print(board.name)
```
