This repository provides a professional-grade, component-based Python client for issue tracking. It demonstrates a robust architecture by building an abstract interface and a concrete implementation backed by the [Trello REST API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/rest/api-group-cards/).

The project emphasizes strict separation of concerns, dependency injection, and a comprehensive toolchain to enforce code quality and best practices.

## Architectural Philosophy

This project is built on the principle of "programming integrated over time." The architecture is designed to combat complexity and ensure the system is maintainable and evolvable.

- **Component-Based Design:** The system is broken down into two distinct, self-contained components. Each component has a single responsibility and can be reused or replaced with minimal effort.
- **Interface-Implementation Separation:** Every piece of functionality is defined by an abstract **contract** implemented as an ABC (the "what") and fulfilled by a concrete **implementation** (the "how"). This decouples business logic from specific technologies (like Trello).
- **Dependency Injection:** Implementations are "injected" into the abstract contracts at import time. Consumers of the API only ever depend on the stable interface, not the volatile implementation details.

## Core Components

The project is a `uv` workspace containing two primary packages:

1. **`issue_tracker_client_api`**: Defines the abstract `Client` base class (ABC). This is the contract for what actions an issue tracker client can perform (e.g., `get_issues`, `get_board`, `get_boards`, `get_members_on_card`).
2. **`trello_client_impl`**: Provides the `TrelloClient` class, a concrete implementation that uses the Trello API to perform the actions defined in the `Client` abstraction.

```

## Project Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- `uv` – A fast, all-in-one Python package manager

### 2. Initial Setup

1. **Install `uv`:**
    ```bash
    # macOS / Linux
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    # Windows (PowerShell)
    irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex
    ```

2. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/riddhixraina/ospsd-team-07.git
    cd ospsd-team-07
    ```

3. **Set Up Trello Credentials (for E2E tests):**
    - Obtain your [Trello API Key](https://trello.com/app-key) and [Token](https://trello.com/1/authorize?expiration=never&scope=read,write&response_type=token&name=ospsd-team-07&key=YOUR_API_KEY).
    - For local development, either:
      - Set environment variables:
        ```bash
        export TRELLO_API_KEY="your_api_key"
        export TRELLO_TOKEN="your_token"
        export TRELLO_BOARD_ID="your_board_id"  # Optional, for e2e tests
        ```
      - Or create `token.json` in the project root with `{"token": "your_token"}` and set `TRELLO_API_KEY`.
    - **Important:** Credential files contain secrets and are ignored by `.gitignore`.
    - For CI/CD: Set `TRELLO_API_KEY`, `TRELLO_TOKEN`, and `TRELLO_BOARD_ID` in CircleCI Project Settings.

4. **Create and Sync the Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    uv sync --all-extras
    ```
    This creates a `.venv` folder and installs all packages (including workspace members and development tools) defined in `uv.lock`.

5. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    # macOS / Linux
    source .venv/bin/activate
    # Windows (PowerShell)
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

## Development Workflow

All commands should be run from the project root with the virtual environment activated.

### Running the Toolchain

- **Linting & Formatting (Ruff):**
    The project uses Ruff with comprehensive rules configured in `pyproject.toml`.
    ```bash
    # Check for issues
    uv run ruff check .
    # Automatically fix issues
    uv run ruff check . --fix
    # Check formatting
    uv run ruff format --check .
    # Apply formatting
    uv run ruff format .
    ```

- **Static Type Checking (Mypy):**
    ```bash
    uv run mypy components/issue_tracker_client_api/src components/trello_client_impl/src
    ```

- **Testing (Pytest):**
    ```bash
    # Run all tests (unit, integration, e2e)
    uv run pytest

    # Run only unit tests (fast, no external dependencies)
    uv run pytest -m unit

    # Run only integration tests (mocked dependencies)
    uv run pytest -m integration

    # Run only end-to-end tests (requires Trello credentials; skips if missing)
    uv run pytest -m e2e

    # Run tests with coverage reporting
    uv run pytest --cov=components --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html:htmlcov
    ```

### Viewing Documentation

This project uses MkDocs for documentation.
```bash
# Start the live-reloading documentation server
uv run mkdocs serve
```
Open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to view the site.

## Testing Infrastructure

The project implements a testing strategy designed for both local development and CI/CD environments:

### Test Categories

- **Unit Tests** (`components/*/tests/`): Fast, isolated tests with mocked dependencies
- **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/`): Tests that verify component interactions and dependency injection
- **End-to-End Tests** (`tests/e2e/`): Full workflow tests against the real Trello API

### Test Markers

The project uses pytest markers to categorize tests:
```python
@pytest.mark.unit          # Fast unit tests
@pytest.mark.integration   # Integration tests
@pytest.mark.e2e          # End-to-end tests (skipped if credentials missing)
```

### Authentication in Tests

- **Local Development:** Set `TRELLO_API_KEY`, `TRELLO_TOKEN`, and optionally `TRELLO_BOARD_ID` in the environment, or use `token.json`.
- **CI/CD Environment:** Set the same variables in CircleCI Project Settings.
- **Missing Credentials:** E2E tests are skipped with a clear message; unit and integration tests run normally.

## Continuous Integration

The project includes a CircleCI configuration (`.circleci/config.yml`) with:

- **Lint Job:** Ruff (check + format) and Mypy
- **Test Job:** Unit, integration, and e2e tests with coverage; JUnit results and HTML coverage stored as artifacts

See [docs/ci-cd.md](docs/ci-cd.md) for detailed CI/CD setup instructions.

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:** `uv sync --all-extras`
2. **Run tests:** `uv run pytest -v` or `uv run pytest -m "unit or integration" -v` (skip e2e if no credentials)
3. **Check code quality:** `uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .`
4. **Fix formatting:** `uv run ruff format .`
5. **View documentation:** `uv run mkdocs serve`

### Best Practices

- Run unit tests (`uv run pytest -m unit`) during development for fast feedback
- Use integration tests (`uv run pytest -m integration`) to verify dependency injection and component interactions
- Run full test suite (`uv run pytest`) before pushing to ensure CI compatibility
- The CircleCI pipeline provides automated validation on every push
